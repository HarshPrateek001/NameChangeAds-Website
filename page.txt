Gazette Notification for Name Change in Karnataka

What is a Gazette Name Change?
A Gazette name change is the official legal process of publishing your updated name in the Government Gazette, creating a public record that establishes its validity across India.
Legal Purpose
This publication serves as primary proof linking your old and new names, required for updating official documents like Aadhaar, PAN, passport, and bank records. It ensures transparency to prevent fraud and is mandated under acts like the General Clauses Act, 1897.
Key Process Steps
Prepare a notarized affidavit, publish ads in newspapers (one English, one regional), then submit to the Gazette office with proofs and fees. Approval leads to publication in the e-Gazette, downloadable as your certificate (typically 25-45 days).
Validity and Use
The notification holds standalone legal standing under the Indian Evidence Act, recognized by all institutions, though some may request supporting docs like clippings.
