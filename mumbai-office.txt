                    <h2>What is a Gazette Name Change?</h2>
                    <p>A Gazette name change is the official legal process of publishing your updated name in the Government Gazette, creating a public record that establishes its validity across India.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-primary mt-6">Why Gazette Publication is Required?</h3>
                    <ul class="info-list">
                        <li><strong>Undisputed Legal Proof:</strong> Essential for updating Aadhaar, PAN, Passport, Banks, and IDs nationwide.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Ensures transparency to prevent fraud, disputes, or identity theft through public notice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mandatory for Official Use:</strong> Required for government jobs, exams, and central records under the Indian Evidence Act.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-4">The notification holds standalone legal standing, recognized by all institutions.</p>

                    <h2>How It Works: Step-by-Step Process</h2>
                    <p>Once you share your documents, we kick off the process immediately. Here is the typical workflow:</p>
                    
                    <ol class="ordered-list">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Affidavit Creation:</strong>
                            <p class="mb-1">We draft a clear, notarized affidavit spelling out your old name, new name, and reason—tailored just for you.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Newspaper Ad:</strong>
                            <p class="mb-1">Your name change gets announced publicly in a trusted national or local Karnataka paper (English + Kannada).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Digital Prep (CD/Text):</strong>
                            <p class="mb-1">We format the exact Gazette notice in MS Word and burn it to a CD for seamless submission as required by the office.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <p class="mb-1">We handle the challan payment (typically ₹1,100+), attach the receipt, and keep everything transparent.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Application Filing:</strong>
                            <p class="mb-1">Everything gets bundled—affidavit, ads, CD, proofs, fees—and submitted to the Gazette office via post, courier, or the eRajyapatra portal.</p>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Gazette Publication:</strong>
                            <p class="mb-1">Once approved (typically 4-6 weeks), your notice hits the Gazette of India or Karnataka eRajyapatra. You can download the PDF to update your official IDs!</p>
